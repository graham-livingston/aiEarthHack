business_idea = 'A company that provides a service to help people find the best deals on flights. The company would have a website where users can enter their travel dates and destinations. The website would then search for the best deals on flights and display them to the user. The user would then be able to book the flight through the website. The company would make money by charging a fee for each flight booked through the website. The company would also make money by selling advertising space on the website.'

prompt = f'Analyze the following business idea according to specified rules and create a detailed JSON representation. The goal is to describe the business as a series of resource states and the processes that transform that resource. Each resource state and process should have an index which is sorted to describe a linear story that can help people understand the business.The JSON should include resource states, processes, citations, and questions where details are unclear or missing.\nBusiness Idea Description: {business_idea}\nRules for JSON Structure:\n\nresources:\n\n\tList every resource involved in the business followed by any resource that is just a change in the previous resources state.\n\n\tUse odd numbers for indexing each resource state.\n\n\tInclude a description and direct quotes from the provided text for each state.\n\n\tDetermine "start" and "end" indices for each citation, indicating the position of the quoted text.\n\nprocesses:\n\n\tDetail every process that transforms a resource from one state to another.\n\n\tUse even numbers for indexing processes.\n\n\tInclude a "quotes" section with details on "who", "what", "where", and "how" for each process.\n\nquotes:\n\n\t\twho: this should include the person or group of people who are involved in the process. If the text does not specify, do not add this field.\n\n\t\what: this should include the quote from the text that describes what the process is. If the text does not specify, do not add this field.\n\n\t\where: this should include the quote from the text describing the location where the process takes place. If the process involves moving a resource from one place to another, this should read "in transit", If the text does not specify, do not add this field.\n\n\t\how: this should include the quote from the text describing how the process is carried. If the text does not specify, do not add this field.\n\n\tIf any of the aspect is not explicitly described, do not add the field.\n\nCitations:\n\n\tProvide citations for all resources, processes and quotes if they are included in the text.\n\n\tCitations should include accurate "start" and "end" indices for the cited material.\n\n\tCitations for quotes should be a single sub-field for each quote that is available.\n\n\tCitations for processes and references should be on the same level as the description and reference the position where the concept described can be found. Again, only include citations fields for concepts that are described in the text.\n\nquestions:\n\n\tThe goal of the questions is to show what questions, that if answered, would provide the information needed to create a complete JSON representation.\n\n\tIf aspects (who, what, where, how) of a process are not clearly described, or a process or resource state is not described and thus cannot be cited, add a "questions" section at the same level as "quotes" with the field name from the field that couldnot be cited.\n\n\tFor the value of the field, include questioins that you formulate that if answered would provide the missing details.\n\nUndefined States or Processes:\n\n\tIf the text does not define a subsequent resource state for a rescource before describing another process that acts on it, or if a process is missing between state changes of a resource, create a placeholder in resources or processes in the location that was skipped.\n\n\tFrame relevant questions for these undefined processes or resource state changes that if answered could provide the full json requirements.\n\nBest Practices for Structuring the Business Idea:\n\n\tClarity and Sequential Order: Present the business idea in a clear, logical order.\n\n\tDetailing: Provide specific details about each process and resource state.\n\n\tComprehensive Descriptions: Ensure descriptions are detailed for accurate citation extraction.\n\n\tCoverage of Key Aspects: Make sure to cover who is involved, what the process entails, where it takes place, and how it is executed.\n\nHere is an example of a JSON representation of a business idea and its accompanying example business idea. Be sure to follow the same bracket and json formatting \ syntax that is in the example.\n'
